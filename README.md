# task-printer
This is a to-do list automator that will also physically print a nice to-do list on paper every week. I am making this because I manage a mechanic whose job it is to do regular maintenance on my organization's vehicles. The tasks to do on the vehicles are scheduled into bundles: some every 2 months, some every 4 month, some every 12 months. This series of scripts keeps track of what jobs need to be done, when they were last done, and when they are completed, shuffling tasks on and off of the master todo.txt list accordingly. Each Monday in the wee hours of the morning a cron job will run the scheduler and renderer and print out a nice physical checklist of what jobs need to be done that week.
At the end of the week, I'll take the checklist and use reporter.py to report what was completed and update the todo.txt list.
